This is a fun word game I made in a single day. I hope you enjoy

## How to run

 - **Linux** - Install the "Love2d" or "lÃ¶ve" from your distro's repo. Download the "real word.love" from the releases and you should be able to doable click it or run the "love" command and point it to the  file.
 - **Windows and Mac** - I don't know, I'm sure you could package it yourself.
 - **Chromebook** - For the total of zero people who might be playing on a Chromebook, download the love2d app from the Play Store and open the "real word.love" file from the releases in it. I recommend resizing the window down.
 - **Web browser** - To run the game in your web browser, [click this](https://raythenoob.github.io/real-word/). (it is most likely not working ðŸ˜­~~strikethrough text~~)
 
 ## How to play
Press space bar to start a game. You will be presented with a row of letters on the bottom. Use the arrow keys to move your selection. The letter your currently have selected with be higher up than the others. Press space bar to type it. If you make a four letter word you go on to the next level!
